I'm working on a detailed guide so you can help out with the code! Stay tuned.

Right now, just clone, run `npm i`, run `node setup` (only first run), and run `npm run build` (always), and start with `node .`

Before making a PR, set `PRODUCTION=true` in the `.env` file, and run `node setup` and `npm run build`. This will make a production build which can be deployed on our servers.

Thanks!

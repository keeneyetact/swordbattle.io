## Contributing

I'm working on a detailed guide so you can help out with the code! Stay tuned.

Right now, just clone, run `npm i`, run `node setup` (only first run), and run `npm run build` (always run after changes), and start with `node .`


## Code Usage

You can use this code as a base for your IO games, but please change it to a considerable amount, so it's a whole different game, and please give me credit. Under the GPL License, your game **MUST** also be open source. You cannot just take my code and make it proprietry. Thanks.

Thanks.
